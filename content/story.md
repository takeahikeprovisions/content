Adventuring in the outdoor playground of the Pacific Northwest has inspired our lifelong passion for
nature and sustainability. With Seattle as our home base, we are fortunate to have world class hiking,
sailing and skiing right in our back yard. On our many trips, we found challenges provisioning healthy, tasty
dinner options without growing landfills. In the spirit of making the outdoors easier to enjoy,
we started Take a Hike Provisions.

Our just add water dehydrated meals are not only tasty and healthy, they also eliminate packaging waste.
Unlike other backcountry dinners, our meals are sold in re-usable, recyclable and compostable materials.
You can now feel good that your purchase is helping to promote a healthy and sustainable outdoors for all
generations. Bring your Take a Hike Provisions silicone bag, add boiling water and you are all set for
a flavorful meal by the campfire. Remember, [leave no trace](https://lnt.org/).

We thank you for trying our products and wish you many adventures in the great outdoors or wherever
your travels take you!

Now... Take a Hike!
